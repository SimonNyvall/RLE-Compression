A small hobby project to better understand lossless compression. Run Length Compression is one of the more less complicated algorithms to implicate.

## Compile and run
Compile the program with g++ and execute the a.out file with two arguments for the starting and ending path.
```
g++ Compress.cpp
```
```
./a.out [in_path] [out_path]
```
